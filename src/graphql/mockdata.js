        HQwords focuses on the power of expressions – words, feelings, body language and actions. The aim is to encourage, build and entertain while creating a conscious grip on quality words. HQwords started on September 14, 2017, as a way of projecting and promoting my writing – poetry – which led to the registering of the domain name and online presence built solely on my collection of poems – Vials of Almonds. However, this will not suffice as the core of the themes in the writings fronted here are Life, Nature, and Religion. Therefore, the aim of HQwords was remodeled to reach out – to develop a part of our everyday life especially for the teens and young adults and call them to action to promote positive social change related to how we express ourselves. As an extension, this idea was integrated into my facebook page in December 2017, as a campaign to capture attention to promote the vision.
        Our programs are designed to suit people of different ages. We strike a balance between developing the mind and creating an avenue to have fun. As the name implies, the focus is to Hold to Quality Words. Our training sessions are designed to inspire and create a balance between work and life; for the teens – school and life.
